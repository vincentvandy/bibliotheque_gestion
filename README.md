====================
--School Project--  
Admin section for a library where a user can borrow a book.  
you can browse the current borrowings, the delays are highlighted.  
You can contact the user via a modal form where template mail is already built with the name of the borrower, the title, the amount of the fine and some polite words.
You can also browse the books and members table.  
On the home page you can see how many delays there are. You can only select availaible books in the form (aint-it crazy?).  
All of that in french with french comment... I know thats baaad...  
The design is made with bootstrap
